# UltrasoundModels

Simulations of ultrasound transducers in a concave array. The simulations are performed in both FieldII (http://field-ii.dk) and FOCUS (https://www.egr.msu.edu/~fultras-web/). This project also includes a GUI to view simulation results and search through these images via parameters of the array.
